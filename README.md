Project Name: Guesing Game

Description: This project is a JavaScript game developed to help users get to know me using a series of Yes/No questions. These questions range from my favorite color, to my age, to the location where I live.

Joke: Why did Simba's dad die? Because he didn't MU-FAS-A 'nuff. (Say it out loud...it's not as funny when you just read it. Also, apologies for those still recovery from the emotional turmoil The Lion King caused in all of our childhoods.)
